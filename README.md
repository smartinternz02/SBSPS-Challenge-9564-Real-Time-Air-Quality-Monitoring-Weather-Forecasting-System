Real-Time Air Quality Monitoring &amp; Weather Forecasting System


Forecasting Air quality is a time series based classification problem. Air Quality depends on the concentration of the constituents of air like CO, benzene, toluene, NO, NOx, ozone and SO2.It also depends on meteorological factors like wind speed and direction, temperature, humidity, rainfall and solar radiation. So the deep learning approach to be used will be working on time series data. Considering the input parameters along with the AQI for past(3-4 Days), we can predict the Air pollution for the next 72 hours(3 Days). 
Deep learning techniques that we use are 
⫬Long short Term Memory (LSTM)
⫬Multi Layered Perceptron (MLP)
⫬Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU)

Ensemble of Various deep learning model provides even more accurate results than the predictions made with a single model. So the three models have been ensembled to generate a single model with good performance.
